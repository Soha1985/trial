         <h1>5 Ways to Decode Your Baby's Body Language</h1>
         <p>
        <h2>Baby Body Language Guide</h2>
         <p>

            I'm a celebrity-magazine junkie, so I consider myself an expert when it comes to reading the body language of all those A-listers. But when it comes to interpreting my own 3-month-old's body language, my skills aren't quite so sharp. Despite the fact that Addy is my third child, I'm often hopeless at reading her hiccups, head bobs, and odd hand positions. Yesterday, for example, I assumed that her intense sucking on her fists meant that she was hungry, so I fed her until she spit up all over her shirt and mine.

            Tuning in to your child's gestures is crucial, especially before they can speak. "Baby behavior definitely conveys messages that tell you what your child needs," says J. Kevin Nugent, Ph.D., director of the Brazelton Institute in Boston and author of Your Baby Is Speaking to You. "Being able to read and respond will make your baby happier, as well as help you learn a lot about her personality and temperament."
            
            For the parents like me who get lost in translation, infant pros offer insight into interpreting some common baby moves. Use these communication "clues" to understand your own little VIP.

           <h3> 1. Arching Back</h3>
            <p>
A toddler may make this move as an act of rebellion, but when infants unleash the arch, it may be a reaction to pain. In that case, heartburn is the most likely culprit, says Ari Brown, M.D., author of Baby 411.

<h3>2. Constant Kicking</h3>
You might have a future soccer player or Rockette, but what's behind the kiddie kick line right now? It depends on how they are acting otherwise. "If your baby seems happy and smiley, it's probably a sign that they want to play," says Claire McCarthy, M.D., assistant professor of pediatrics at the Harvard Medical School at Children's Hospital Boston. But if your baby is fussy or crying, it's likely an indication that something's bothering them.
          <p>
Your move
"It could be anything from gas to a dirty diaper to a cramped car seat, so do a quick once-over to see what might be bugging her," says Dr. McCarthy. Just know that some babies kick their legs simply because they can. If you determine nothing is wrong, it might be a good time to start researching soccer camps, just sayin'.

<h3>3. Head-Banging</h3> 
Seeing your 10-month-old using their head like a drumstick to methodically bang it on the hardwood floor or against the bars of their crib is alarming. But a lot of little ones do this routinely without appearing to cause themselves any pain. But, ouch, why?Your move
           <p>
Your move
Don't completely ignore it. "If your baby bangs their head for long periods of time instead of engaging with others or playing with their toys, then you should bring it to your pediatrician's attention at a checkup," says Dr. Brown. Bear in mind, most kids give up this behavior by age 3, so if the behavior is persisting past then, it's another good indication to check in with a doctor.
          <p>
<h3>4. Grabbing Their Ears</h3>
Don't immediately assume that tugging equals an ear infection. "Many parents jump to that conclusion, but most of the time your baby has just realized that she has ears," says Dr. Nelson. Indeed, Seattle Children's Hospital explains that children who have ear-pulling as their only symptom rarely have an ear infection. (The ear infection symptoms that you should watch for, however, include fever, stuffy nose, and trouble sleeping at night.)
    <p>
Your move
Cheer your baby on for locating this body part, but keep your eye on it. "Sometimes babies will pull on their ears when they're teething, particularly when the 1-year molars are coming in," says Dr. Brown. If that seems to be the case, bring on the teething rings and extra snuggles to help make them more comfortable.
          <p>
<h3>5. Clenched Fists</h3>
babies usually start to open up their hands by 8 weeks and begin reaching and grabbing by 3 to 4 months. But clenched fists can sometimes be a sign of stress or even hunger, says S. Michelle Long, a certified baby nurse in New York City. "I find that when babies are very hungry, they tense up all over."
<p>
Your move
For babies under 3 months, be sure your little one isn't hungry or fussy. You could also try introducing toys, like a soft rattle to help them hold. If your child's tendency to clench their fists persists after 3 months, check in with their doctor.
